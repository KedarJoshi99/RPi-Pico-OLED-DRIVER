# RPi-Pico-OLED-DRIVER
RPi Pico SDD1306/SH1106 OLED DRIVER

This is yet another Raspberry Pi Pico driver for the ubiquitous OLED displays.
These routines are standard C files so they are a little clunky to use but
  are also streamlined and reasonably fast. The routines are not my own but have
  been adapted from freely available online Arduino and other Pico source files.
  
These are not object oriented and would likely benefit from making them so.

I have included a CMakeLists file, an example and a bitmap file (image.h)
to demonstrate use of these routines.
